2	D.Va Bunny	999	images/bunny.png	D.Va's iconic symbol!	D.Va is a former professional gamer who now uses her skills to pilot a state-of-the-art mech in defense of her homeland. She is a very competitive individual, and coupled with her pro-gamer skills, this makes her an extremely effective mech pilot. Never backing down, D.Va always plays to win.  While she projects a carefree, irreverant attitude, D.Va is burdened by the emotional cost of defending her homeland, and the facade the South Korean media projects on her.
3	Hammond	999	images/hammond.png	The scrappy, intelligent hamster known as Hammond!	Described as "witty and conniving," Hammond is capable of speech, just not in any human language. His mech (named "Wrecking Ball") translates his comments into English, via a soundboard. The mech itself is equipped with a minor AI. Winston is the one individual Hammond can converse with normally as they're both animals.
4	Lúcio Logo	1499	images/lucio.png	Lucio's iconic symbol, the frog with headphones.	Lúcio is an international celebrity who inspires social change through his music and actions. He has a positive, up-beat attitude, and is always looking towards the future. Lúcio wears hard-light skates that project hard-light "blades," allowing him to traverse any surface.[5]
5	MEKA Logo	1299	images/meka.png	The logo of MEKA, the Mobile Exo-Force of the Korean Army	MEKA exists primarily as a mechanized walker force. It also has access to infantry, medical, and search-and-rescue support (either within the unit or through the South Korean Army).
6	Snowball	1499	images/snowball.png	Mei's incredible weather-modification invention and cheerful companion, Snowball!	Snowball is a small, blue dome-shaped drone capable of creating isolated flurries of snow and ice, freezing everything and everyone surrounding it. The "eyes" are shapes shown on an LED screen or an equivalent that serve as a face, changing shape to communicate mood. The screen can serve as a flashlight, show images (e.g. a battery sign) and letters and numbers. It is usually docked on the capsule on Mei's back, and is able to detach itself at will. Snowball moves around by hovering, through the use of three adjustable thrusters for "feet". It has a playful and sometimes mischievous personality.
7	Soldier Logo	999	images/soldier.png	Soldier's iconic symbol and identifier, the number "76"	Currently the target of an international manhunt, the vigilante known as Soldier: 76 wages a personal war to expose the truth behind Overwatch's collapse. Due to his genetic enhancement, he can heal wounds and acclimatize much faster than a normal human. He has always been a light sleeper. He was a fan of Indiana University basketball and was also a fan of Westerns...at least until he met Jesse McCree. He is of Catholic faith. He has a smile that he uses to get himself out of trouble, though is usually taciturn. He is well-read, showing interest in historical generals, and is a chess player, apparently admiring Bobby Fischer. The mask he wears distorts his voice.
8	Sombra Logo	1499	images/sombra.png	Sombra's calling card, often used to taunt the victims of her hacking skills.	One of the world's most notorious hackers, Sombra uses information to manipulate those in power. Sombra's skills include computer hacking and cryptography; these are activities she greatly enjoys, to the point where the desire to get past locks and solving mysteries is ingrained in her personality. She is a known associate of Reaper, specializing in espionage and intelligence assessment. She is equipped with devices that allow hacking of technology just through touch. This includes a cybernetic graft implanted along her spine, which basically makes her a living computer. She is a loner emotionally, finding it difficult to make friends (outside coercion). Her personal calling card is a sugar skull.
